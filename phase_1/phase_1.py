This file includes terms extracted from ad titles and descriptions; for our purpose, suppose a term is a consecutive sequence of alphanumeric,
underscore '_' and dashed '-' characters, i.e [0-9a-zA-Z_-]. The format of the file is as follows: for every termT in the title or the 
description of an ad with id a, there is a row in this file of the form t:a where t is the lowercase form of T. Ignore all special characters 
coded as &#number; such as &#29987; which represents ç”£ as well as &apos;, &quot; and &amp; which respectively represent ', " and &. Also ignore terms 
of length 2 or less. Convert the terms to all lowercase before writing them out.
